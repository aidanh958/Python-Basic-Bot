# Python-Basic-Bot
I made a basic bot using python

to ask it a question just activate the question() function from the shell

it has 5 programed responses to question plus if you say NVM the it just cancels

programed questions:

  1. how old are you
  2. where are you
  3. what is your name
  4. what version are you
  5. what are you
  
It also has a command center thing that is EXTREMELY basic just type Run() in the shell

programed commands:

  1. login
  2. close
  3. server view
